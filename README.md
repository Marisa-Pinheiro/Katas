## Overview
This repository is dedicated to storing my solutions for various Code Katas, implemented in TypeScript, JavaScript, and Java. Code Katas are small coding exercises that focus on improving algorithmic problem-solving skills and coding techniques.

## Description
This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to Code Katas. Each kata is organized into its own directory, containing the problem statement, input/output examples, and my solution code. The goal is to showcase my approach to problem-solving and coding style while providing a resource for others to learn from.

## Languages
The repository includes solutions in three languages:

* TypeScript: *.ts files
* JavaScript: *.js files
* Java: *.java files
